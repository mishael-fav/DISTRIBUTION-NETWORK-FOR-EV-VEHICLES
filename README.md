	```python
    sns.set(style="whitegrid")
    sns.set_palette("pastel")
    
    #create a 2x2 subplot grid

    #plot the distribution of electricity consumption
    sns.histplot(data= Distribution_Data, x='Electricity_Consumption (kWh)', bins= 30, kde=True, ax=axes[0, 0])
    axes[0,0].set_title('Distribution of Electricity Consumption')
    axes[0,0].set_xlabel('Electricity Consumption (kWh)')
    axes[0,0].set_ylabel('Frequency')
    
    #plot the distribution of EV types
    sns.countplot(data= Distribution_Data, x='EV_Type', ax=axes[0, 1])
    axes[0,1].set_title('Distribution of EV Types')
    axes[0,1].set_xlabel('Count')
    axes[0,1].set_ylabel('EV Type')

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show() ```

- Bivariate Analysis
  	- Use geospatial data to visualize the locations of substations and EV charging stations
  	- Analyze the Capacity of transmission lines
  ![EV Substations and charging station](images/EV%20Substations%20and%20charging%20station.png)
- Code Snippet:
   ```python
      #Convert the Dataframes into Geodataframes
      EV_gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(Distribution_Data, geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(Distribution_Data.EV_longitude, Distribution_Data.EV_latitude))
      substation_gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(Geospatial_Data, geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(Geospatial_Data.substation_longitude, Geospatial_Data.substation_latitude))
      
      #Load the world map data
      world = gpd.read_file("/content/drive/MyDrive/EV ANALYSIS/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp")
      
      
      #Zoom in to North America (area of focus)
      north_america = world[world.CONTINENT == 'North America']
      
      #plotting the map for north america
      fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 10))
      north_america.boundary.plot(ax=ax, linewidth=0.5, color='lightgrey')
      north_america.plot(ax=ax, color='lightblue', edgecolor='black')
      
      #plotting the substations on the map
      substation_gdf.plot(ax=ax, color='blue', marker='s', markersize=100, label='Substations')
      
      #plotting the EV charging stations
      EV_gdf.plot(ax=ax, color='red', marker='s', markersize=10, label='EV charging station', alpha=0.5)
      
      #set title
      plt.title('North America EV Substations with its designated EV Charging Stations')
      plt.xlabel('Longitude')
      plt.ylabel('Latitude')
      
      plt.legend()
      plt.tight_layout()
      plt.show()
   ```

3. **Network Capacity Assessment**
- To perform Network Capacity Assessment:
	  - Calculate the Total Electricity Consumption for each substation
	  - Compare the Total Electricity Consumption with the transmission line capacity
	```Python
	#group the ev distribution data by substation id and calculate the total electricity consumption for each substation
    total_consumption_per_substation = Distribution_Data.groupby('Substation_ID')['Electricity_Consumption (kWh)'].sum().reset_index()
    
    #merge the total consumption data with geospatial data
    network_capacity_data = pd.merge(Geospatial_Data, total_consumption_per_substation, on='Substation_ID')
    
    network_capacity_data.rename(columns={'Electricity_Consumption (kWh)': 'Total_Electricity_Consumption (kWh)'}, inplace=True)
    
    #Calculating the ratio of total consumption to transmission line Capacity
    #the conversion rate of 1MW = 1000 kWh
    network_capacity_data['Consumption_to_Capacity_Ratio'] = network_capacity_data['Total_Electricity_Consumption (kWh)'] / (network_capacity_data['Transmission_Line_Capacity (MW)'] *1000)
	```
4. **Identify Bottlenecks**
- By analyzing the map, we can identify the substations and the areas that are potential bottle necks in the distribution network. These are areas where the consumption are high

	```Python
	#filtering the c2c greater than 1
	bottleneck_substations = network_capacity_data[network_capacity_data['Consumption_to_Capacity_Ratio'] >= 0.9]
	```


## Key Insights to Optimizing Network Upgrades:
âœ…For optimizing network upgrades, focus on substations with potential to have high Consumption_to_Capacity_Ratio. 
âœ…Upgrading the transmission lines or adding additional capacity in these areas can hlp in managing the potential to have increased load effectively and ensure grid reliability.
#### Aditionally, lets note from the analysis;
âœ…The Geographical distribution of EV substations; where EV charging stations are quite far from the substations.
